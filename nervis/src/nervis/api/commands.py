"""Carrying out the one thing a person confirmed (§12).

**This is the only place in NERVIS that acts on another service.** Everything
else reads. §12 governs what that may look like: an enumerated set of
operations, no free-form command or process-selection path, a switch per family
that defaults to off, and an audit trail. All four are visible below —
`commands.OPERATIONS` is the set, the request names an operation by id rather
than describing one, the credential setting is the switch, and every attempt is
published to the hub whether it succeeded or not.

**What arrives here is a confirmation, not an instruction.** The proposal was
built from the person's own words in `nervis.commands`, shown to them with what
it would do written on it, and reached this endpoint because they pressed the
button. Nothing a model produced is involved at any step — §11.5's rule that a
model's reading of NERVIS's evidence may never become an action holds because
there is no path from model output to this function.

**The specification is fixed here, and that is the point.** §9 forbids benchmark
logic in NERVIS, and this is not any: it is the same standard experiment the
Benchmarks screen has always submitted, named once so the operation is closed.
A version that forwarded whatever specification a caller supplied would be the
free-form path §12 exists to prevent, dressed as a parameter.
